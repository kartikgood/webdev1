    <h1>Swati Maliwal case: Kejriwal's aide Bibhav Kumar sent to 3-day police custody</h1>
    <img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/28/550x309/bibhav_kumar_1716900785251_1716900785533.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Delhi's Tis Hazari Court on Tuesday sent Arvind Kejriwal's aide Bibhav Kumar to three days police custody in the Swati Maliwal alleged assault case.

        The Delhi Police had sought five days' custody of the accused. Kumar’s counsel opposed the Delhi Police's plea for his custodial interrogation, claiming it had no evidence.
        
        The court order comes a day after a Delhi court rejected Kumar's bail plea in the case, saying that there appeared no "pre-meditation" by AAP MP Swati Maliwal in lodging the FIR and that her allegations could not be "swiped away."
        
        "The allegations raised by the victim have to be taken on their face value and cannot be swiped away. The mere delay in registering the FIR would not have much impact on the case as the injuries are apparent in the MLC after four days," additional sessions judge Sushil Anuj Tyagi had said.

        During the hearing, Bibhav Kumar's counsel N Hariharan had argued that the case was registered on ‘concocted’ charges against his client on May 16, days after the alleged incident on May 13 at Arvind Kejriwal's residence.</p>

            <p>The sixth phase of the Lok Sabha election 2024 took place on May 25, and the country is now gearing up for the seventh and final phase of the polls. The seventh phase of the general elections will take place on June 1, and the results will be announced on June 4. The campaigning for the final phase of the polls is intensifying just as mercury remains soaring across northern states. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav will hold a joint rally in Varanasi today, which is the home constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
                PM Narendra Modi is contesting the polls from Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency, set to vote on June 1. His opponents include Ajay Rai from the Congress and Athar Jamal Lari from the Bahujan Samaj Party. Varanasi is a stronghold for the BJP, and PM Modi won the polls from the parliamentary seat in both 2014 and 2019 general elections.
                
                The UP Congress chief, Rai, was also fielded by the Congress against the PM in Varanasi in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha polls, but he finished third both times. This is the third time Ajay Rai will face Modi in a Lok Sabha contest.
                
                The Bharatiya Janata Party expressed confidence after the sixth phase of the polls that they are close to touching the 400-seat mark, and will cross the same after the seventh phase of the election.

            <p>Renu Bhatnagar, born in New Delhi, managed to buy two houses, a Bentley, a Ferrari and visit 16 countries in just one year. Previously, she worked for minimum wage in one of the Indian banks. So how did she manage to earn so much money in one year? She tells us her story.

                "For four years, I worked as a customer consultant at a bank branch. I completed my studies in banking and finance with distinction and thought that working at a bank would be the realization of my dreams. I hoped to earn a lot of money and have the opportunity to make a career, but I had to start with the lowest salary at the bank. Unfortunately, for 4 years, I did not receive a single raise or promotion opportunity, in addition to having more and more responsibilities. I was almost falling into depression because I did not know what to do and did not want to change jobs to start all over again without guarantee that it would be better."
                
                Renu needed to work a lot because she had a loan for a small one-bedroom apartment, which took more than half of her salary. She lived alone, so she couldn't count on anyone's help. In addition, rising inflation made it increasingly difficult for her to make ends meet at the end of the month. The loan and store prices were rising, unlike Renu's salary.
                
                "On a rainy day, a regular customer walked into the branch. He was smiling from the entrance, which really surprised me because he had been depressed lately. He sat next to me and told me he wanted to pay off all his loans and open an account that operated overseas, because he was going to take a long vacation."
                
                I was very surprised, because in recent months he was late in paying the bills and risked being evicted for having trouble paying the home loan, and now there was a large amount of money in his account. I saw that he had received a transfer of ₹416,852,2 from Trader AI. It was the first time I saw that name...".</p>
